            <p><b>What is organic farming?</b></p>
            <p>Organic farming system in India is not new and is being followed from ancient time. 
                It is a method of farming system which primarily aimed at cultivating the land and raising crops in such a way, 
                as to keep the soil alive and in good health by use of organic wastes (crop, animal and farm wastes, aquatic wastes) and other biological 
                materials along with beneficial microbes (biofertilizers) to release nutrients to crops for increased sustainable production in 
                an eco friendly pollution free environment.
            </p>
            <p>As per the definition of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) study team on organic farming “organic farming is a system 
                which avoids or largely excludes the use of synthetic inputs (such as fertilizers, pesticides, hormones, feed additives etc) and to the 
                maximum extent feasible rely upon crop rotations, crop residues, animal manures, off-farm organic waste, mineral grade rock additives and 
                biological system of nutrient mobilization and plant protection”.
            </p>
            <p>FAO suggested that “Organic agriculture is a unique production management system which promotes and enhances agro-ecosystem health, 
                including biodiversity, biological cycles and soil biological activity, and this is accomplished by using on-farm agronomic, biological 
                and mechanical methods in exclusion of all synthetic off-farm inputs”.
